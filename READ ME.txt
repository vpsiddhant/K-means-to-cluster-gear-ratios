* "code.py" contains the code used
* "output_followup.csv" contains the labelled output
* "avg.txt" contains the average gear ratio for each cluster and the silhouette score

# Algorithm

* Removed all outliers in RPM and and Speed by removing all readings having standard deviation more than 3 for
  better clustering and normalization
* Removed all readings with speed zero to compute gear ratio = RPM/Speed in the steps ahead
* Normalized the values of RPM and Speed
* Found gear ratio for each row and introduced it as a new feature in the dataset
* Used multi dimensional k-means to form cluster using k-means,rpm and speed as features
* Found average gear ratio of each cluster
* Found silhouette score to check whether the clusters formed are optimal
* Transcribed all output as CSV and text file.
